Hisilicon Hip05 Soc NAND controller DT binding

Required properties:

- compatible:          Should be "hisilicon,hip05-nfc".
- reg:                 The first contains base physical address and size of
                       NAND controller's registers. The second contains base
                       physical address and size of NAND controller's buffer.


Example:

	nand: nand@68010000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hip05-nfc";
		reg = <0x0 0x68010000 0x0 0x10000>, <0x0 0x68020000 0x0 0x10000>;
	};
