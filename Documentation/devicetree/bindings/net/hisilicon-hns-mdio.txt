Hisilicon MDIO bus controller

* sub controller node

Required properties:
- compatible:
	"hisilicon,peri-c-subctrl","syscon" if mdio connects to sub-ctrl
	"hisilicon,io-wrap-ctrl","syscon" if mdio connects to io-wrap-ctrl
- reg: address and length of the register set for the device.

Properties:
- compatible: can be one of:
	"hisilicon,hi1382-mdio"
	"hisilicon,hi1616-mdio"
	"hisilicon,hns-mdio"
	"hisilicon,mdio"
  "hisilicon,hns-mdio" is recommended to be used for hip05 and later SOCs,
  while "hisilicon,mdio" is optional for backwards compatibility only on
  hip04 Soc.
- reg: The base address of the MDIO bus controller register bank.
- subctrl_vbase: sub control base addr
- #address-cells: Must be <1>.
- #size-cells: Must be <0>.  MDIO addresses have no size component.

Typically an MDIO bus might have several children.

Example:
	mdio@803c0000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "hisilicon,mdio","hisilicon,hns-mdio";
		reg = <0x0 0x803c0000 0x0 0x10000>;
		subctrl_vbase = <&peri_c_subctrl>;
		ethernet-phy@0 {
			...
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};
